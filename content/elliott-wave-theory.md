Beginning this article with a quote *"History repeat itself"*.

After, watching the Indian stock market and being a investor for more then a year, now decided to study about *"Elliott Wave Theory"*. Why need to study, may be to understand or to make money.

Elliott found that the upward and downward swings of the mass psychology always showed up in the same repetitive patterns, which were then divided further into patterns he termed *"waves"*.

In the financial markets we know that *"every action creates an equal and opposite reaction"* as a price movement up or down must be followed by a contrary movement. Price action is divided into trends and corrections or sideways movements. Trends show the main direction of prices while corrections move against the trend.

It took me long time to understand that *"Market is not the place for emotions and only for number"*.
